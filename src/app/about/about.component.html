                I moved to Nashville in 2009 to attend Belmont and study Music Business. After graduating in 2013, I realized that the music
                industry wasn't as fulfilling as I had hoped. In my spare time I began using Codecademy to learn
                the basics of web development. I realized that my passion was really in development. I knew I needed
                some education beyond what Codecademy could provide so I joined Nashville Software School in April
                2016.

                Since graduating from NSS I have had many great opportunities including, teaching at NSS.
                I helped teach Python, Ruby, and C# while I was there. After teaching, I took a position at a marketing agency working with Craft CMS, Vue, and Laravel.
                I'm currently working with Python, Flask, Angular and AngularJS.

                My dog, however, is still not happy with my chosen career path. Or really any career that involves leaving the house without
                him.
