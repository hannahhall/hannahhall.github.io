		<h1>About</h1>
		<div class="bio">
			<p>I moved to Nashville in 2009 to attend Belmont and study Music Business. After graduating in 2013, I realized the music industry wasn't as fullfilling as I thought it would be. I needed something new. In my spare time I began using Codecademy to learn the basics of web development. Soon, I knew I needed some education beyond what Codecademy could provide. I joined Nashville Software School in April 2016. It has been an amazing learning experience. The learning will never end as I continue on my journey as a web developer.
